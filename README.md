## *an evolving machine learningapproach for two-player dominoes*

### Overview

In this project we train agents using different machine learning approaches such as supervised learning, reinforcement learning and alpha go zero to play the game of Dominoes for two players. As a result from this project we developed a framework that generalizes our implementation to any approach and game.


The code inside src, correspond to the full-working framework describing game dynamics with ASP, and [Game Description Language (GDL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Description_Language) which allows the formalization of any finite game with complete information. Furthermore, any desired approach to learning strategies can be easily configured to make use of the full code and pre-made structures. 

We invite the reader to look into more details of the framework [here](./src/README.md). A python notebook is also included containing the more fined grained process for the transfer learning. This was only used as supported, all relevant code is also find within the framework.

The full paper can be found [here](./docs/ProjectPaper/projectpaper.pdf).
