## *Dominos machine learning strategies powered by ASP*

### Overview

In this project we train agents using supervised learning and reinforcement learning to play the game of Dominoes for two players. To do so, we use a framework with Answer Set Programming as engine to describe the game and its dynamics.

#### Game description

The description of the game is represented in ASP and it is called from python using Clingo API to compute the legal actions and successor states providing the game environment.
 
To represent the game encoding the framework requires the use of [Game Description Language (GDL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Description_Language), allowing the formalization of any finite game with complete information. 

#### Dominoes

Its a nice game

Some of the already available games are [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim) and TicTacToe. 


### Learning approaches

#### Reinforcement learning

#### Supervised Learning
